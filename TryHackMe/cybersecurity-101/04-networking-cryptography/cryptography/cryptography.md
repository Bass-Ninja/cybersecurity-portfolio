## üîê Cryptography Basics

**Overview:**  
Understand the foundations of cryptography and the concept of **symmetric encryption**, where the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt data.

**Key Concepts:**
- Plaintext vs Ciphertext
- Encryption/Decryption
- Symmetric key algorithms (e.g., AES, DES)
- Key distribution problem

## üîë Public Key Cryptography Basics

**Overview:**  
Learn how **asymmetric encryption** works using two keys ‚Äî public and private ‚Äî and how it's used in secure communications (e.g., SSH, TLS).

**Key Concepts:**
- RSA and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)
- Public vs Private Keys
- Key pairs and trust models
- Digital signatures
- Real-world usage: SSH, HTTPS

## #Ô∏è‚É£ Hashing Basics

**Overview:**  
Hashing algorithms take input data and return a fixed-size string of characters (hash). Hashing is used for:
- Password storage
- Data integrity verification (e.g., file checksums)

**Key Concepts:**
- Common algorithms: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, bcrypt, PBKDF2
- Properties of good hashes: deterministic, collision-resistant, non-reversible
- Salting and key stretching
