# Command Line Fundamentals

## 🎯 Objective  
Learn the basics of command-line interfaces (CLI) across Windows and Linux environments, focusing on essential commands, scripting capabilities, and how these tools assist in cybersecurity tasks such as automation, penetration testing, and incident analysis.

## 🛠️ Environment  
- Windows 10/11 (Command Prompt, PowerShell)  
- Kali Linux (Bash Shell)  
- Tools used: Command Prompt, PowerShell, Bash Terminal

## 🔍 Steps and Observations  

### Windows Command Prompt  
1. Explored basic commands like `dir`, `cd`, `ipconfig`, `netstat`.  
2. Used `tasklist` to view running processes.  
3. Practiced file manipulation commands like `copy`, `del`, `mkdir`.

### Windows PowerShell  
1. Learned how to run cmdlets like `Get-Process`, `Get-Service`, `Set-ExecutionPolicy`.  
2. Created simple scripts for automation, e.g., listing all services.  
3. Explored how PowerShell offers more powerful and flexible scripting compared to Command Prompt.

### Linux Bash Shell  
1. Navigated the file system using commands like `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`.  
2. Managed files with `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, and changed permissions with `chmod`.  
3. Created and ran simple shell scripts.  
4. Used piping and redirection to chain commands and manipulate output.

## 📊 Analysis and Results  
- The CLI is a powerful tool for managing and configuring systems quickly.  
- PowerShell enhances Windows administration with scripting capabilities close to programming languages.  
- Bash shell scripting enables automation and complex task execution in Linux environments.  
- Proficiency in CLI tools is essential for cybersecurity professionals, especially for tasks like reconnaissance, exploitation, and incident response.

## 📝 Key Takeaways  
- Mastery of basic CLI commands speeds up system interaction and troubleshooting.  
- PowerShell scripting is a key skill for Windows security automation.  
- Bash is indispensable for Linux-based security tasks and scripting.  
- Combining commands with pipes and redirection increases efficiency.
