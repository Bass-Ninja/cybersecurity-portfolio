# Practical Example of Defensive Security

## Scenario Overview
In this room, I stepped into the role of a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst tasked with protecting a bank. The SOC uses a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool to collect and analyze security events from multiple sources, providing a centralized dashboard for monitoring suspicious activity.

## Key Concepts

- **SIEM Tool Functionality:**  
  SIEM aggregates logs and events, generating alerts for activities that could indicate security incidents.

- **Alert Analysis:**  
  Not all alerts are malicious; part of the SOC analyst’s job is to differentiate between false positives (e.g., multiple failed logins by a legitimate user) and real threats (e.g., unauthorized access attempts from unknown IP addresses).

- **IP Address Awareness:**  
  Understanding that an IP address identifies a device on the Internet helps analysts evaluate the legitimacy of incoming connections.

## Hands-On Experience: SIEM Simulation

- Navigated a simplified, interactive SIEM simulation.
- Investigated security events step-by-step to identify suspicious activities.
- Located the “flag” (formatted as `THM{RANDOM_WORDS}`) as proof of successfully completing the challenge.

## Lessons Learned

- Real-world SOC analysts need both technical skills and judgment to prioritize and respond to alerts effectively.
- SIEM tools are vital for centralizing security event data, but human expertise is essential to interpret the results.
- Continuous vigilance and adaptability are necessary as cyber threats constantly evolve.

## Next Steps

- Gain familiarity with real SIEM platforms such as Splunk, Elastic Stack, or Wazuh.
- Develop skills in log analysis, incident prioritization, and alert tuning.
- Explore further DFIR and threat hunting exercises to deepen practical knowledge.
