# Intro to Defensive Security

## Overview
This room covers foundational concepts in defensive security, focusing on:

- Security Operations Center (SOC) and Threat Intelligence  
- Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR), including Malware Analysis  

---

## Key Concepts Learned

### Security Operations Center (SOC)
- SOC is a centralized unit that monitors, detects, and responds to cybersecurity incidents in real time.
- SOC analysts use threat intelligence to stay informed about emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and attack tactics.
- Threat intelligence helps prioritize alerts and improves incident response effectiveness.

### Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
- DFIR is the process of identifying, investigating, and mitigating cybersecurity incidents.
- Digital forensics involves collecting and analyzing digital evidence to understand how an incident occurred.
- Incident response focuses on containing and eradicating threats and recovering systems to normal operation.
- Malware analysis is a critical part of DFIR; it involves examining malicious code to understand its behavior and impact.

## Tools and Techniques Mentioned
- Common forensic tools for evidence gathering and analysis.
- Techniques for malware analysis to identify payloads and attack methods.
- Incident response frameworks and best practices.

---

## Lessons Learned
- SOCs play a critical role in maintaining organizational security through continuous monitoring and threat intelligence.
- Effective DFIR requires both technical skills and a methodical approach to investigation.
- Understanding malware behavior is key to developing strong defenses and responding quickly to threats.

---

## Next Steps
- Gain hands-on experience with SOC tools like SIEM platforms (e.g., Splunk, ELK).
- Practice forensic analysis using tools like Autopsy or Volatility.
- Explore advanced malware analysis techniques including sandboxing and reverse engineering.
