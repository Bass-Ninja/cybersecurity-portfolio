## Cybersecurity Portfolio
Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio! This repository documents my hands-on learning journey as I build skills in ethical hacking, network security, incident response, and threat analysis. Inside, youâ€™ll find detailed lab walkthroughs, practical projects, custom scripts, and write-ups from platforms like TryHackMe and beyond.

My goal is to showcase my growing expertise and practical experience in cybersecurity to potential employers and collaborators. This portfolio will continue to evolve as I progress through different learning paths and real-world challenges.
